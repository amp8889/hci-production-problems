## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://drpete.co/blog/25-point-website-usability-checklist

3. https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/is-your-website-user-friendly-a-25-point-website-usability-checklist-info/528678/
I put 3 links because I found it funny that I found the exact same list on 2 completely different websites

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1.  Ensure that load times are reasonable
2.  Ensure the navigation is obvious and simple to use
3.  Ensure that the background does not clash with the text color
4.  Ensure that not too many objects on are the screen at one time to avoid overwhelming the usernames
5.  Ensure that the site structure is the same throughout the entire site
6.  If you have a search bar, Ensure that it is easy to use and works properly
7.  Ensure that all links are obvious that they are links
8.  Ensure that you have little to no horizontal scrolling
9.  Ensure that you website works on varying degrees of of screen sizes
