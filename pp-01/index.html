<h1>Osvald and Roboto Condensed Compared</h1>
<p>Both of these fonts share a similar weight and boldness. They rely heavily on family.
Both of these fonts are actually very similar to each other which also shows that
they seek the similar well. </p>
<p>Roboto Condensed is also a slightly modified version of the Roboto font which
in my opinion looks and works better than the original roboto font.</p>
<p>Osvald is a newer font when compared to some of the other fonts that have been around
for half a decade. It has a more modern look to it as well</p>
